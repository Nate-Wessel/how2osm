# OpenStreetMap

This document is meant to introduce the reader to OpenStreetMap - what it is, how to use it, and when and why you might want to. I will primarily write this for an audience that has some interest in making maps, especially in an urban setting, and who may want to go beyond maps (visuals) to think about how data can be used for analytic, spatial analysis applications. I hope the reader will have some familiarity with QGIS, and/or Python for which there will be some example code, but most of the information here should generalize to other applications as well.

I mean only to tease and entice here. OpenStreetMap is a deep, _deep_ resource and also a community. I myself have been involved in that community since 2012, when I first started mapping parts of my hometown in Ohio as a way of goofing off during a graduate course on spatial statistics. Since then, I've published many maps based on OpenStreetMap data, and in turn have contributed over two million individual map edits and counting. I mostly edit around Toronto now, where I live and work, as a data scientist for the City. Perhaps you'll find some of my work useful in your own projects.

## What is OpenStreetMap?

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a wide-ranging, collaborative mapping project spanning the entire world. It could be described as Wikipedia, if Wikipedia were a map. Anyone with a computer can contribute edits and can also download and use that data, along with the contributions of millions of others, for a wide range of uses.
